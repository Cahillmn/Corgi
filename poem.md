# Hope :sparkles:

Hope is the thing with *feathers*
That perches in the soul,
And sings the tune without the words,
And never stops at all,

And **sweetest** in the gale is heard;
And sore must be the storm :cloud: :zap:
That could abash the little bird :bird:
That kept so many warm.

I've heard it in the _chillest_ :snowflake: land,
And on the strangest sea;
Yet, never, in extremity,
It asked a crumb of me.

--Emily Dickinson
